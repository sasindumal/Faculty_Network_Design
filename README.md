# 🌐 **University of Jaffna Network Topology Design - EC4060 Assignment** 📡

Welcome to the repository for the **EC4060 – Computer and Data Network** course assignment! This project involves designing and simulating a network infrastructure for a multi-branch institution, covering various key networking concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer. Below you'll find all the necessary resources and details about the project.

## 🔍 **Project Overview**:

This network topology design simulates the setup for a **multi-branch institution** with the following components:

- **Main Router**: ISR-321 Router 🖧
- **Main Switch**: 3650-24PS Layer 3 Switch 🔌
- **Layer 2 Switches**: 7 switches for different departments ⚙️
- **VLANs**: Separate VLANs for each department and administration 👥
- **Devices**: PCs, printers, laptops, and mobile phones in each VLAN 📱💻

### Key Requirements:
- **Separate Subnets** for 5 academic departments and 1 administration section 🧑‍🏫
- **VLAN Categorization** for logical network separation 🔐
- **Subnet Calculations** with future scalability for 30% growth 📊
- Configuration of **Routers, Switches, VLANs**, and **IP Addressing** 🔧
- **Testing Connectivity** via ping and traceroute 🧪

## 🖼️ **Network Topology Diagram**:

Here’s a visual representation of the designed network topology:

### Diagram Features:
- **Main Router (ISR-321)**: Centralized routing for the network.
- **Main Switch (3650-24PS)**: Core switch connecting multiple departments and layers.
- **Layer 2 Switches**: Separated VLANs for different departments.
- **VLANs**: Logical separation of network traffic for optimal security and performance.

## 💾 **Files Included**:

- 📂 **Network Configuration Files**: All router and switch configurations for the network setup.
- 📂 **Cisco Packet Tracer Save File**: The complete Cisco simulation file (.pkt).
- 📂 **Screenshots & Videos**: Step-by-step guide and testing results for easier understanding of the network topology.
- 📂 **Subnet Tables & VLAN Mappings**: Detailed tables for subnetting and VLAN configurations.
